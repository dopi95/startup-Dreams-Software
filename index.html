        <p>
          the idea was born when Elyas Yenealem noticed that many local schools,
          hospitals and any other companies were still using manual systems to
          manage their daily tasks. As a passionate developer and student, i
          decided to create tools that solve real community problems through
          technology. I brought together a team of classmates and friends who
          believed in the power of local innovation. We are a group of 4
          including me. There name is Bereket Eshete, Tenbite Daniel and Dagim
          Sisay. Together we launched Dreams Software to provide accessible,
          customized and practical software solution.
